# Instructions for Mentors

## Event details

- <b>E5, University of Waterloo. August 15th.</b>
- We wrote some guides on how to get here. They can be found [here](https://github.com/TechRetreat/mentors/getting_there).
- Preferably come at 7h15am if possible. 

You can drop off your stuff there and we will head to M3 together for the opening ceremony a bit later. 
A few of you mentioned that you might show up later, and that’s fine, but please let me know!

How long is it? It would be great if you can stay until around judging time so that is 6h30pm. You can stay around for the closing ceremony if you like too! 
In the morning/evening we may need your help shuttling people between E5 (our hacking space) to M3 (opening/closing ceremony space).

Then for the rest of the day, you will either be mentoring for the learnathon or hackathon (we’re keeping things fluid, so you can move around if you want). You will be given an awesome #FF0000  shirt and nametag so students can identify you!

For Hackathon, you are free to roam around the room and help out students in need, but we'll set up an area where mentors can stay so hackers can just go there for help.

For Learnathon, we will have organizers covering teaching, and mentors are welcome to help out with the whole process and take an active role in making the event awesome for everyone!
