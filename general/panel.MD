# Speakers Panel

At 3:00 PM, we'll be hosting the speakers panel.  During this time, we'll have a guided question and answer period where an organizer will ask the panelists questions.  After that, there will be a free discussion for anybody to ask questions.

To ask a question feel free to raise your hand during the panel, if you're shy feel free to direct message **@panashemahachi** your question on Slack.

### Andrew Paradi
Andrew was in Laurier BBA and now he’s in 2A CS and Economics.  When Andrew was in first year he cofounded a startup that made intuitive website analytics for businesses and he had a wild ride.  Shortly after creating the first version he had the Yale School of Management join his platform. He eventually applied and got to the final stage of [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/), arguably the most prestigious seed fund company in the world which produced startups like Dropbox, Airbnb and Reddit. The partners told him his team was ideal, but weren’t necessarily the best for the idea.  Now, Andrew is hungrier than ever to build businesses.

### Moez Bhatti
Moez was a CS student and he’s an interesting Hackathon Hacker.  Before Moez started school at Waterloo, he pushed himself to learn Android development and he started developing an SMS app called [QKSMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moez.QKSMS&hl=en).  This got him known among the Reddit Android community and at Hack the North last year it landed him full time job offer at Enflick.  So two weeks into school, he left to work full time! From there he continued to develop QKSMS and it’s now at over 250 thousand downloads.  Now he’s working on a new startup named [OneSet](https://www.oneset.co/) that’s a Vine for fitness and things are looking up as they’ll be featured on Dragon’s Den this fall.
