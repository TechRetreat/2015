#Getting there, by car

##From the GTA

Take the 401 heading west to London. Get off at the Highway 8 - Kitchener/Waterloo exit, and take highway 8 heading towards Kitchener. At the Highway 7/8/85 interchange in Kitchener, take highway 85 north to Waterloo. On highway 85, take the University Ave (West) exit, not to be confused with the University Ave (East) exit a kilometre earlier.

Due to construction for ION Light rail transit, University Ave will be closed on the weekend of Tech Retreat between Phillip St and Seagram Dr. To reach the campus, continue west on University Ave and turn right on Phillip St, left on Columbia St and then finally left on Hagey Blvd.

Pick-ups and drop-offs can be done at Mathematics 3, which can be reached by turning left at the stop sign at Ring Road, and turning right at the service road right past the General Services Complex on the right. Detailed parking information will be provided closer to the event date.

##From London/Windsor

Take the 401 heading east to Toronto. Get off at the Highway 8 - Kitchener/Waterloo exit. After this point, directions are similar to those coming from the GTA.

##From Hamilton/Niagara Falls

Take highway 403 heading east to Toronto (if you’re entering the 403 from the Hamilton/Brantford end), or west to Brantford/London (if you entered the 403 from the QEW). Take the highway 6 north exit to Guelph, and follow highway 6 north until highway 401. Take the highway 401 west (London) on-ramp, and follow highway 401 until the Highway 8 - Kitchener/Waterloo exit.

Directions beyond this point are identical to those listed under “From the GTA” above.
