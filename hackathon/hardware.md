# Lendable Hardware

You are also welcome to bring your own hardware to hack on!

## To get Hardware
We'll have a booth/table set up on the 3rd floor in Engineering 5. After the hackathon starts, we'll announce when you can come by and pick up hardware.

Please send a group member with Government ID (we'll hang onto this until you return the hardware) and a pitch for what you're planning to do with it.

Hardware will be returned at Mathematics 3.
