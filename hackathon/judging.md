# Judging Process

At 6:30 PM, the hacking period will end, and we'll be transitioning to the Hackathon Showcase. 

During this time, there will be 2 teams of 3 judges. One team of judges will come by to your team, and you can present your hack to them for 3 minutes. This is going to be done science-fair style, so you'll just be demoing at your table.
The judges will be focusing more on the technical side of your project, rather than a business pitch.

After all the projects have been presented, each team of judges will come up with a list of their top 3 teams. 
The combined total of 6 teams will present to everyone, and the entire panel of 6 judges, at the closing ceremonies. 

After all teams have presented, the panel of 6 judges will determine the top 3 teams.

API Prizes will be judged and presented by the Sponsor awarding it.
