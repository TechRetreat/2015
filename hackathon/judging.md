# Judging Process

At 6:30 PM, the hacking period will end, and we'll be transitioning to the Hackathon Showcase. 

During this time, there will be 2 teams of 4 judges. One team of judges will come by to your team, and you can present your hack to them for 3 minutes. This is going to be done science-fair style, so you'll just be demoing at your table.
The judges will be focusing more on the technical side of your project, rather than a business pitch.

After all the projects have been presented, each team of judges will come up with a list of their top 3 teams. 
The combined total of 6 teams will present to everyone, and the entire panel of 6 judges, at the closing ceremonies. 

After all teams have presented, the panel of 6 judges will determine the top 3 teams.

API Prizes will be judged and presented by the Sponsor awarding it. Click [here](https://github.com/TechRetreat/documents/blob/master/hackathon/prizes.md) to check them out.

## Judging Criteria

### Technical Difficulty
The pure difficulty of the your implementation of the project. When judging this we'll take into account the usage of an API to implement the core feature of the project and how complex the project looks.

We'll weigh the hacks on an [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) scale.  For full marks, try to make something that he couldn't create.

Technical Diffictuly will be assigned a weight of **35%**

### Creativity
The originality of your idea, approach, implementation, and/or design of the project.

For full marks try to create something that uses the [Mantis Shrimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp)'s ability to see sixteen colours to prevent discrimination.

Creativity will be assigned a weight of **25%**

### Usefulness
The value of the real world applications that can result from your project.  This will be measured in the genuine difference it will make in everyday life.

An example of a project that will receive full marks is one that solves world hunger. (Try to be Bill Gates after he was 40 years old)

Usefulness will be assigned a weight of **25%**

### Overall Impression 
Extraneous things about your project (like design and potential business applications) that stand out.

Hacks that the judging team believes should win an [Apple Design Award](https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/) will be given full marks.

Overall Impression will be assigned a weight of **15%**
