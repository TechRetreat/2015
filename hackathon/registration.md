# Registration

This applies to everyone - not just hackathon participants! 

Registration starts at 8 AM; the Opening Ceremonies start at 9 AM and end at 9:30 AM. 

We'll be ending registration at M3 at 9:30 AM, when we move to Engineering 5. 

If you're running late to Tech Retreat, come up to the Second Floor Atrium of E5 and register there with our front desk. 

Please have your Liability form signed and stapled. 
Depending on how you filled it out, you or your parents will have to sign in (and out at the end of the day).
