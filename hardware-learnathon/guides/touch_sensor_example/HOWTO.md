#Making a Touch Sensor

It's possible to turn any metal object into a touch sensor by measuring its *capacitance*. This example
shows how to turn a small sheet of aluminum foil into a touch sensor using the CapacitiveSensor library.

##What We Need

- 1x 10MÎ© resistor

- Arduino UNO
- Wires (at least 3)
- Aluminum foil, metal paperclip, tape

##How To Do It

1. First, download [`CapacitiveSensor.zip`](CapacitiveSensor.zip?raw=true) and follow the instructions in
[`importing_libraries.md`](../importing_libraries.md) to import it into Arduino.

2. Build a circuit like the one shown below. You can use tape and/or a paper clip to attach the wire to a piece of aluminum foil (or any metal object, for that matter).

3. Check out the simple example program [`touch_sensor.ino`](touch_sensor.ino), which shows how to use the touch sensor to turn on an LED.

##Extensions

Once you have it working, it's time to start using touch sensors. Try improving your piano
program to use touch sensors instead of push buttons, or work on a new project that you think would
make good use of them. Remember, you can now use any metal object as a sensor!

##How It Works

Capacitive touch sensors take advantage of the human body's natural capacitance. Details are
outside the scope of this tutorial - if you're interested, take a look at
