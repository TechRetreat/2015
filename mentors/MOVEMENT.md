# Inter-Building Movement

During Tech Retreat, there are two times that we need to move participants between buildings. 

1. From M3 to E5 after the Opening Ceremonies
2. From E5 to M3 after the Hackathon Showcase, in time for dinner and the Closing Ceremonies. 

## 1. M3 to E5 (around 9:25 AM)
After the Opening Ceremonies, an announcement will be made for the participants to meet at certain areas in M3 1006.
* Hardware Learnathon - Bottom Left
* Software Learnathon - Bottom Right
* Hackathon - Back

Hardware Learnathon mentors will move the Hardware Learnathon participants over to E5 3052.

Software Learnathon mentors will split between the Software Learnathon participants (going to E5 2004) and the Hackathon participants (going to E5 LiveLink).
To make moving Software Learnathon and Hackathon participants over easier, one or two mentors/volunteers will move them in groups of 10 at a time. 

General volunteers will be wrapping up registration or will be in E5. Any remaining volunteers will help move Hackathon participants over. 

## 2. E5 to M3 (around 7:20 PM)
After the Hackathon Project Showcase (learnathon participants are invited to watch), all participants will return to their original rooms (E5 2004/3052/LiveLink).
Once everyone has returned, we will move that group of people over to the M3 atrium for dinner, and the Closing Ceremonies.

Any questions about the process? Ask Deon or Cora on slack! :)

## Route
Walk along Math Road (the road between MC and M3, with Plant Ops) east towards Engineering 5 and Ring Road.
Then walk south along Ring Road towards Engineering 5 and enter in the front to the second floor.

### Rain Plan
If it happens to rain, walk up to the third floor of M3 to the bridge between MC and DC, turn towards DC, continue on the third floor of DC until
you hit the corridor towards E3's first floor. From there, go to the staircase/elevator that will bring you to E5 and cross to E5 via the bridge
which will leave you on the third floor.
